# Full-Stack E-Commerce Solution

A high-performance, responsive e-commerce platform built with the MERN stack. This project demonstrates a production-ready approach to decoupled architecture, featuring secure authentication, real-time state synchronization, and cloud-integrated media handling.



## 🚀 Key Features

* **Admin Dashboard:** Full CRUD operations for product management with real-time stock updates and data visualization.
* **Media Management:** Secure image uploading, storage, and optimization via the **Cloudinary API**.
* **Dynamic Shopping View:** Responsive product listings with advanced filtering and sorting by category and brand.
* **Real-Time Cart:** Persistent shopping cart with server-side stock validation to prevent overselling.
* **Secure Checkout:** Integrated **PayPal Sandbox** environment supporting international USD transactions.
* **Order Management:** Comprehensive order history and status tracking (Pending, Shipped, Delivered) for users.

## 💡 Technical Challenges Overcome

### 1. Cross-Border Payment Integration
**Problem:** Encountered regional Sandbox restrictions for domestic Indian transactions within PayPal.
**Solution:** Implemented a **Currency Abstraction Layer** that standardizes transaction payloads to USD. This ensured seamless compatibility with the PayPal REST SDK while maintaining a consistent checkout experience regardless of the developer's locale.

### 2. State Synchronization & Data Integrity
**Problem:** Keeping the Redux frontend state in sync with the MongoDB backend during multi-step checkouts.
**Solution:** Orchestrated **Asynchronous Thunks** to manage side effects. I engineered the flow so that critical actions—like stock deduction and cart clearance—trigger atomically only *after* the payment gateway confirms successful capture.



### 3. Asynchronous Media Handling
**Problem:** Latency between third-party image uploads (Cloudinary) and database persistence causing "ghost" products.
**Solution:** Developed a pre-submission validation hook that ensures the Cloudinary asset URL is successfully returned and bound to the product model before the final POST request is sent to the Express server.
